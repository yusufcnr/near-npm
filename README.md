# Salary Management System
This repo is for the project which needs to be submitted after completion of the Near Developer Cours on Patika.dev. 
We will be making a dapp on Near Blockchain which has following feature.

There will be some workers and their level will be different. 
They will have some parameters based on their level.
Basically there are 2 factor impacting the salary of a worker:
Title  and Experience. 
titles will be scored between 1-5 (worker, technician, engineer, sr. engineer, manager) and experience will be (number_of_year_worked / 3). basically you get 1 level higher in terms of experience.

At the end of the week (friday at 5:30 pm) all rewards will be distributed. 

There should be some company wallet. 
everyone should connect 

save a worker, give hime a title, set start date/time. 

manager can give some bonus.
